# This is a project help you build userscript with webpack

Just [use this git repo as a template](https://github.com/Trim21/webpack-userscript-template/generate).

[中文说明](./readme.cn.md)

## dev

1. Allow Tampermonkey's access to local file URIs [tampermonkey/faq](https://tampermonkey.net/faq.php?ext=dhdg#Q204)
2. install deps with `npm i` or `npm ci`.
3. `npm run dev` to start your development.

Now you will see 2 files in `./dist/`

-   `dist/index.dev.user.js`: **You should install this userscript in your browser.** It's a simple loader that load `dist/index.debug.js` on matched web page.
-   `dist/index.debug.js`: This is the development build with `eval-source-map`. It will be automatically loaded by `dist/index.dev.user.js` via `@require file://.../dist/index.debug.js` metadata, **Don't add it to your userscript manager.**

4. edit [src/index.ts](./src/index.ts), you can even import css or less files. You can use scss if you like.
5. go wo <https://www.example.com/> and open console, you'll see it's working.

livereload is default enabled, use [this Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei)

### NOTICE

Everytime you change your metadata config,
you'll have to restart webpack server and install newly generated `dist/index.dev.user.js` UserScript in your browser again.

## used package

If you prefer some other bundler like rollup, you can use some of these packages directly.

[userscript-metadata-generator](https://github.com/trim21/userscript-metadata-generator)

[gm-fetch](https://github.com/trim21/gm-fetch)

[userscript-metadata-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/trim21/userscript-metadata-webpack-plugin)

## Cross Site Request

you can call `GM.xmlHttpRequest` directly or use a fetch API based on `GM.xmlHttpRequest` <https://github.com/Trim21/gm-fetch>

## TypeScript

use typescript as normal, see [example](src/index.ts)

## dependencies

There are two ways to using a package on npm.

### UserScript way

like original UserScript way, you will need to add them to your [user script metadata's require section](./config/metadata.cjs#L16-L18) , and exclude them in [config/webpack.config.base.cjs](./config/webpack.config.base.cjs#L18-L20)

### Webpack way

just install packages with npm and import them in your code, webpack will take care them.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

`dist/index.prod.user.js` is the final script. you can manually copy it to greasyfork for deploy.

### Minify

There is a [limitation in greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/help/code-rules), your code must not be obfuscated or minified.

If you don't need to deploy your script to greasyfork, enable minify as you like.

## automatically Deploy

[github actions](./.github/workflows/deploy.yaml#L36) will deploy production userscript to gh-pages branch.

[example](https://github.com/Trim21/webpack-userscript-template/tree/gh-pages)

[deployed](https://trim21.github.io/webpack-userscript-template/index.prod.user.js)

You can auto use greasyfork's auto update function.

## Q&A

you may find enabling source map not working well in production code, because Tampermonkey will add extra lines (all your `@require`) before your script. I don't know if there is a good fix for this, You need to use webpack config `devtool` with `eval` prefix to make it work as expected, so source map is disabled in this production build.
